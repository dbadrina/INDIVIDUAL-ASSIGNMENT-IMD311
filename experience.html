<font size="5" face="Candara"> <center> After finishing my studies as a form five student and getting my SPM results, I decided to work at Secret Recipe as a waitress. At that time, the entire country was hit by the Covid-19 virus and the Malaysian government required people to take a second dose. Anyone who has completed the average dose taken is allowed to dine-in at the restaurant while those who have not completed the dose are prohibited from eating at the restaurant to avoid widespread infection. Because I only had the opportunity to work for one month, so they placed me to take care and check the customer's well-being before allowing them to enter the store. Not only that, but many other things I was able to gain working there even for a short period of time. </font> </center>

<font size="5" face="Candara"> <center> During the third semester break of 2022, I plan to work for a while for 3 months as an admin assitant at J&T Express. Although I only had 3 months of work experience, I was able to learn a lot of new things while working there. Although I held the position of admin assistant, because of the newly launched J&T store, the boss could not hire many employees at one time. The J&T is a franchise organization compared to J&T which directly connects to the superiors.Fortunately, I got a boss who is very kind and considerate of the workers, for example, when there are many parcels that need to be managed on one day, the boss generously buys us water or food for the workers. </font> </center>

<font size="5" face="Candara"> <center> During the third semester break, I was sent to a six weeks of industrial training alongside my fellow students. I have picked the ANGKASA company's library to train as a librarian for my diploma degree from 2021 to 2023. Although this is not my first job, it is my first time doing industrial training within a university branch. As a result, the experience obtained differs differently from past efforts.I was also responsible for writing a report and filling in a blog book provided by the university with daily activities carried out during 6 weeks of continuous industrial training. </font> </center>
